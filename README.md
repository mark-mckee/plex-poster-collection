# plex-poster-collection
My collection of Plex posters for movies and tv shows, as well as title cards. 

## Attributes
A large number of the posters were gathered from [The Poster DB](https://theposterdb.com/), with some coming from Google image results. I do not have the proper attributes to these posters as I did not collect them on the way. None of the artwork in this collection is mine, all rights to their respective owners. 

## Textless
I like to use textless posters for my collection. A large portion of the images that I have collected have been modified to remove the movie/show title as I could not find textless versions. 

## Title cards
Title cards are generated with [TCM](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker). A massive thanks goes out to CollinHeist for creasting this app! I have customised the settings using TCM to generate a number of title cards, and I have also grabbed a number of them from the excellent sub-Reddit [PlexPosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlexPosters/top/#res:ner-page=4). All rights to their respective creators.
